# DeleteSrcComments
Remove all Korean comments from your sources
**To use this script, you have to clear your sources from korean LC_TEXT !**

You could have some problems with *empire_text_convert.py*, because in this file, you've a char var, but with enconding this file in utf-8, the conversation creates two characters and causes an error.
